# Sample Project

## Description 
Write a responsive application that search for books based on user input and present the results. 

## Frameworks
We prefer angularJs 1.6+.
You can use any CSS frameworks to make your life easier. But we would also like to see your styling skills.

## SPECIFICATION
- The user wants to have a result of a search for a book title by using a search box and hitting ‘Enter’ then on click on a record on result set a modal will appear to show **detailed** information of the book.
- The result should be paginated like 100 record per page. (as documented on API) and on the bottom the pagination should be calculated and showed to the user.
	* note : The API response has ‘start’ and ‘num_found’ attributes

## What we are looking for
How you design and structure an application given a set of requirements.
How you build maintainable code.
How you manage the MVC Model.

## Build/Run
Use any build tools you prefer but we use Grunt for angular1.x and webpack and AngularCLI for angular2+
We want to run your application, so please provide a brief description on how to build, run and test your project.

## Hints
We don't have any time limit for this test, but we believe you can finish it within several hours.
We would like to see a production quality project. Keep in mind edge cases and error handling. Let us see your understanding of it from code, build process and view design/layout point of views.
