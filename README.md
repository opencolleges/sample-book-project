# Sample Project
## Description 
Write an application that search for the books based on user input and responds the results. 

## Frameworks
We prefer angularJs or Angular2+ (typescript preferred).
You can use any css frameworks to make your life easier. But we would also like to see your styling skills.

## SPECIFICATION
User wants to have a result of a search for a book title by using a search box and hitting ‘Enter’ then on click on a record on result set a modal will appear to show detailed information of the book.
The result should be paginated like 100 record per page. (as documented on API) and on the bottom the pagination should be calculated and showed to the user.
	* note : on API response it has ‘start’ and ‘num_found’

## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
How you design the structure of an application.
How you manage the MVC Model.

## CSS preprocessor and build tools
Use any build tools you prefer but we use Grunt for angular1.x and webpack and AngularCLI for angular2+

## OTHER
We would like to run your application, so please provide a description of how to run and test your project.
We don't have any time limit for this test, but we believe you can finish it within several hours.
We would like see a production quality project, so let us see your understanding of it from the application code, build process and view layout and design.
